My most faithful friend and strongest motivation, Arlene, is a elegant and a rare vintage like noneother.  This bottle, a tribute to her, detectably captures a ray of her most intoxicating radience, to share with you.  Balanced and beautiful, charming and intelligent, poised and witful, her magnitism, warmth, and vitality are authentically her own.  Duplicating them proved impossible, but of the 3,000 Bottles crafted, the one you hold in your hand is the accolade of which I am most proud, because it is uniquely yours to enjoy!

In 50 years of marriage, I have learned love is eternal, stronger than life or any Earth force.  Like a leaf in the wind of its most exciting journey, this wine brings a second life to a simple fruit.  Using only our finest hand picked grapes, cultivated at towering altitudes, Arlene Serie is barrel fermented in French Oak.  The grapes are then hand pressed, returned to the barrels and laid to a peaceful rest for up to 15 months. A consummate balance of 85% Malbec and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon.
