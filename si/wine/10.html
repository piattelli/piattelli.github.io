					<h3>RESERVE TORRONT&Eacute;S.</h3>	
					<p>High in the Andes surrounding Salta, the distinctively colorful northwest Argentina mountains - formed by many geological layers - inspired our labels. The splendor of this area, with its pure water, high altitude and dramatic temperature swings, makes this not only one of the most beautiful but also one of the premier grape growing regions in the world.</p>

					<h5>AGING.</span></h5>
					<p>100% Torront&eacute;s<br>20% of wine was aged for 2 months in small, first-use French Oak barrels. Wines were then added to non-barrel aged wine and clarified, bottled and aged for 4 months. </p>
					<h5>TASTING NOTES.</span></h5>
					<p>A refreshing, fragrant wine, the color of yellow topaz. This Torront&eacute;s bursts with tropical aromas of pineapple, peach and orange blossom. Aromatic notes resonate in the mouth with fresh apricot and lychee and a hint of orange zest. Acidity is well-balanced in the mouth with a citrusy medium finish.</p>
					<h5>PARINGS.</span></h5>
					<p>Seafood, spicy dishes. </p>
