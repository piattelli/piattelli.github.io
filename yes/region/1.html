					<h5>Cafayate the Beautiful</span></h5>

					<p>Cafayate the Beautiful”, as the locals reference it, is deserving of the name. The Valley has been blessed by its natural landscape and is revered as one of the best regions for growing grapes in the world due to its climate. 
Our winery has been producing outstanding wines relying on the exceptional landscape of this Northern Province, which is also the highest wine-making region in the world. At Piattelli, we are passionately committed to making the most authentic wine from the region in which the grapes originate, with minimal interference in the process. We let the grapes speak for themselves.  
The new labels and wines were created out of a deep respect and affection for the Cafayate region, and the wine showcases the untamed Valle Calchaquíes, where the Andes snow-cap water, free-draining sandy soils and high altitudes give birth to our grapes. The winemakers at Piattelli have demonstrated their outstanding viticultural practices in the undoubtable quality of these excellent wines.

					<h5>Elevation.</span></h5>

					<p>Cafayate sits at 5600ft (1700m) above sea level, and is arguably the best-known wine region other than Mendoza in Argentina. Cafayate is one of the highest regions in the world that is suitable for viticulture. This high altitude is what defines the terrior of the region and makes it suitable for growing grapes despite its close proximity to the equator. Due to the high altitude, Cafayate receives intense sunlight which causes the skins of the grapes to thicken significantly as a protection against the sun. 
Though the days are bright and warm, true to a desert climate the nights can be very cold which causes the growing season to be extended and ultimately leads to a balanced structure in the end.

					<h5>Terrior.</span></h5>

					<p>The soils in Cafayate consist mostly of free-draining chalky loam and in some areas can be quite rocky. The dry soils cause stress in the vines which causes them to produce less vegetation and not as many grapes. One would think this is a bad thing, but in fact, it proves to be very good and that less, truly is more. As there are fewer grapes, all the work the vines do to get these few grapes the nutrients means the concentration of flavors within the grapes rises. 
As Cafayate is a desert-climate, and has very low rainfall and humidity, the vines rely on the meltwater from the Andes to keep hydrated during the particularly dry periods.
