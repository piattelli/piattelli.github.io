					<h5> Two Worlds, One Family.</h5>
					<p>At Piattelli you will find a family that is not as much connected through blood, but rather connected through the love we have for our wines and the craft behind them. Our team is comprised of individuals in both Argentina as well as in the United States, and though we are thousands of miles apart – we work as though we are right next door.</p>
					<p>	“We realized early on that to succeed in our venture meant taking the time to truly care and understand the people, lands, and customs in Argentina. We therefore dedicated ourselves to learn form the best and brightest figures in the Argentina wine community so that we’d hit close to the mark of excellence as possible from the first vintage onwards. Because of the hard work and love our team puts into every vintage, we’ve been able to deliver wines highly rated throughout the world that get better every year.”
Jon Malinski – Owner</p>

					<h5>Bringing You the Best of Two Regions.</span></h5>

					<p>Each region has terriors and climates that are distinct to themselves. Mendoza and Cafayate are two of the best grape growing regions in all of Argentina, and here at Piattelli, we wanted to showcase both.</p>

				<div class="one-third column">

					<h5>Cafayate.</span></h5>

					<p>Elevation: 5,890 ft
Produces primarily: Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Tannat, Cabernet Franc and Torrontés
Our Cafayate winery headed by Alejandro Nesman is a site to be seen. Not only does it produce some of the best wines in the region, but it is an architectural masterpiece. Opened in 2012, our Cafayate winery has quickly become one of the premier wineries and tourist destinations in Salta. The Cafayate Valley is ideal for grapevine cultivation, particularly the Queen of Argentine wines: Torrontés.
Our winery is one of the only gravity-flow vinification systems in Argentina. The system not only lends credence to our commitment to sustainable practices, but also maximizes flavor by preventing grapes from breaking prematurely, seeds from being crushed, and juice from being oxygenated and heated. The curved shape of our innovative concrete egg wine fermenters optimizes circulation and quality by forcing the juice, pulp, and skins into continuous contact throughout the fermentation process.

					<h5>Mendoza.</span></h5>

					<p>Elevation: 3,084 ft/940m
Our Mendoza winery opened in 2002 and is headed by Valeria Antolin, who is the heart of our operations. Located in the foothills of the Andes Mountains, our vineyards rely on irrigation from the pure waters melting from their snow-crested peaks, a significant aspect of what makes our wines exquisite. 
Valeria has been with Piattelli, since the beginning and now claims tribute to our award-winning line of wines – produced from century old vines. Our Mendoza winery is the production hub for the majority of our varietals with a 40,000 case capacity. These vineyards, located in Agrelo - Lujan de Cuyo, Mendoza and Valle de Uco, Mendoza are USDA certified organic as there is no need for pesticides as the area is pest-free due to naturally low-humidity and high altitudes.
