					<h5>Mendoza the Amazing.</span></h5>

					<p>Our Mendoza winery opened in 2002 and is headed by Valeria Antolin, who is the heart of our operations. Located in the foothills of the Andes Mountains, our vineyards rely on irrigation from the pure waters melting from their snow-crested peaks, a significant aspect of what makes our wines exquisite. 
Valeria has been with Piattelli since the beginning and now claims tribute to our award-winning line of wines – produced from century old vines. Our Mendoza winery is the production hub for the majority of our varietals with a 40,000 case capacity. These vineyards, located in Agrelo - Lujan de Cuyo, Mendoza and Valle de Uco, Mendoza are USDA certified organic as there is no need for pesticides as the area is pest-free due to naturally low-humidity and high altitudes. 
According to winemaker, Valeria Antolin, it's impossible to make world-class wine unless you start with world-class grapes. “The best technique in the world won't make up for an environment not perfectly suited to a given varietal [variety of grape],” she says. That's why Piattelli has been so careful to choose ideal locations to establish its vineyards. Currently Piattelli grows its grapes in three areas within two regions. In the Mendoza region we grow our grapes in two different locations: Agrelo, Luján de Cuyo – Mendoza and Tupungato, West Valle de Uco – Mendoza. These areas lie directly east of the Argentine/Chilean range of the Andes Mountains and therefor are sheltered from the salty Pacific ocean-front climate.

					<h5>Agrelo, Lujan de Cuyo, Mendoza</span></h5>

					<p>Piattelli's main winery is in the town of Agrelo, Lujan de Cuyo, a small town 45 minutes outside the major city of Mendoza. Though our winery is in a small winemaking town, the Province of Mendoza is the largest winemaking region in South America. Lujan de Cuyo received Argentina's first Appelation d'Origine Controlee for their winemaking prowess of the Malbec grape. Piattelli's Grand Reserve, Premium Reserve Malbec and Rose of Malbec grapes are grown here, and yield some of the best Malbec wines in the market. </p>

					<h5>Tupungato, West Valle de Uco, Mendoza</span></h5>

					<p>Travel another 20 miles beyond the Piattelli winery in Agrelo, you will enter Tupungato; at nearly 4,000ft above sea-level, it has a higher elevation than both Agrelo and Mendoza City. Our vineyards in Tupungato grow Piattelli's Premium and Grand Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon grapes as well as the Premium Chardonnay grapes. </p>
