					<h3>RESERVE MALBEC-TANNAT.</h3>	
					<pr>High in the Andes  surrounding Salta, the distinctively colorful northwest Argentina mountains - formed by many geological layers - inspired our labels. The splendor of this area, with its pure water, high altitude and dramatic temperature swings, makes this not only one of the most beautiful but also one of the premier grape growing regions in the world.</p>

					<h5>AGING.</span></h5>
					<p>50% Malbec, 50% Tannat<br>Fermented in small, 25,000-liter stainless steel tanks and aged for 8 months in French and American Oak barrels.</p>
					<h5>TASTING NOTES</span></h5>
					<p>This wine is a 50/50 blend of Malbec and Tannat. It has great impact all through the stages of tasting and its passage through the mouth is superb. The wine has hues of violet and contours of black that create an intense ruby color. On the nose, spicy and ripe red fruit aromas mix together with eucalyptus and fig notes. In the mouth, it greets with a pleasant entrance given by the ripe, firm and intense tannins, the result of slow polyphenolic maturation. It has a high structure and acidity that are balanced in a persistent finish.</p>
