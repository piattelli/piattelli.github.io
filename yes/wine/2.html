					<h3>Grand Reserve Trinit&agrave;</h3>	
					<p>Trinit&agrave; is a blend that aims to reflect the best of each harvest through the combination of the best varietals the winery produces. Depending on their quality, the percentage varies in order to obtain the best final blend. Trinit&Agrave; was first made in 2005 and was named in 2007 after "Saint Trinidad," which in this case symbolizes the fusion between these three varieties, Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, to create this special blend for Piattelli, which in its first year was awarded the gold medal from the Argentina Wine Awards.</p>

					<h5>AGING.</span></h5>
					<p>Varietals were aged separately for 13 months in small, first or second-use French oak barrels.</p>
					<h5>TASTING NOTES.</span></h5>
					<p>A complex, elegant wine with a deep ruby hue, Trinit&agrave; tantalizes the senses with an aromatic bouquet of coffee and spice, unfolds across the palate with sweetness and a hint of chocolate, and lingers with a moderate tannin pull and a finish reminiscent of plums and oak.</p>
